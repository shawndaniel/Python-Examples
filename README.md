# Python-Examples
Here you will find various projects that are created for the purposes of practicing Python and documenting my progress with it.
<ul>
  <li><h2>Battleship 2 & 3</h2>
This battleship game expands upon the "Lists and Functions" section of the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python" target="_blank"/>python course</a> on Codeacademy. Specifically following the extra credit as outlined in lesson: 19/19</li>
    <h6>Features added:</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiplayer</li>
      <li>Basic Statistics (current game wins/loses, rematches, best out of 3)</lis>
      <li>Multiple battleship boards</li>
      <li>Battleship boards of different sizes</li>
      <li>("Battleship3" version folder) Added class structure for cleaner code and to allow for unlimited players / boards</li>
    </ul>
  <li><h2>Folder file Count Tracker</h2>
This simple script counts the number of files within all the directories that are located within a given path. Then it sorts the number of files / folder by file count in descending order and calculates the age of each folder.</li>
    <h6>Features:</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculates how old the folder is from when it was created to the current local time</li>
      <li>finds and lists all directories within a given path if the number of files within them are above 0</lis>
      <li>a storage file tracks how many files were counted within each folder since the previous count</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
